# NHPoisson: Modelling and Validation of Non Homogeneous Poisson Processes

Tools for modelling, ML estimation, validation analysis and simulation of non homogeneous Poisson processes in time.

# Rewrite

Poisson processes are useful for modeling counts (e.g. arrivals) over time. This is a rewrite of the [NHPoisson library](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NHPoisson/index.html] with the purpose of improving usability.
